# fre.sh

This is a shell script I wrote to make it easier to get a new (X)Ubuntu user set up
to my own liking.


## Install

  + `apt-get install git`
  + `git clone https://github.com/erikwatson/fre.sh.git ~/fresh`
  + `cd ~/fresh`
  + `./fre.sh`


## Post Install

You could also see this as kind of a todo list.

  + restart the terminal
  + Set the font to Hack
  + run `base16_tomorrow-night` to set the theme
